# @rnv/engine-rn-windows

ReNative Engine to build Windows applications (library development support is to be added).
As the title suggests this engine utilizes React Native for Windows package created and maintained by Microsoft.

Package documentation: https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/0.63/getting-started

> Important note. Current implementation uses React Native Windows version 0.63.4 (even if the 0.65 is already out) as that is the maximum version supported by react-native-tvos package and as we're running them in the same enviroment running two different react native versions in parallel has proven to cause problems.
